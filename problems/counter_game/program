If  is not a power of , reduce the counter by the largest power of  less than .
If  is a power of , reduce the counter by half of .
The resultant value is the new  which is again used for subsequent operations.
The game ends when the counter reduces to 1, i.e., , and the last person to make a valid move wins.

Given , your task is to find the winner of the game.
